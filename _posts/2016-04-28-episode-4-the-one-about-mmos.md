  Notes:

  P.S. Our publishing schedule seriously sucks. This episode was recorded 8 months ago and was a major editing task. That's why we have started doing Sidequests a few months which need nearly no editing compared to regular episodes. The plan is to try and get the editing work needed for episodes down to about as little as sidequests. Time will tell if we succeed or not :)
